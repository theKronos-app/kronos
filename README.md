# Kronos

Kronos is a zero-friction, local-first note-taking application that prioritizes quick capture and simple organization. No complicated setups. No overwhelming features. Just fast, reliable note-taking.

## Project Status

Kronos is currently in active development, focusing on perfecting core note-taking functionality. The current phase prioritizes:

- Lightning-fast capture

- Minimal, focused interface

## Future Development

While we have ambitious plans for Kronos's future, we're committed to maintaining our zero-friction principle. Future features will only be added if they don't compromise the core experience.
